GARDENIA: Graph Analytics Repository for Designing Efficient Next-generation Accelerators
Link: https://github.com/chenxuhao/gardenia
The code infrastructure is ported from GAPBS by Scott Beamer at the University of 
California and Lonstargpu by the ISS group at the University of Texas.
To run the benchmarks on a simulator, please find the revised GPGPU-Sim version here:
https://github.com/chenxuhao/gpgpu-sim-ndp
and we highly recommend you to use CUDA-5.5 for the compatibility issue.

DESCRIPTION
bc: betweenness centrality
bfs: breadth first search
cc: connected components
mst: minimum spanning tree
pr: page rank
scc: strongly connected components
sgd: stochastic gradient descent
spmv: sparse matrix-vector multiplication
sssp: single source shortest path
symgs: symmetric gauss-seidel smoother
tc: triangle counting
vc: vertex coloring

Note that in the code, 'm' is the number of vertices, and 'nnz' is the number of edges.
Graphs are stored as the CSR format in memory.
CSR is represented by two data structures: 'row_offsets' and 'column_indices'.

INSTALLATION
You will need to install gcc and nvcc.
You will also need to download and install CUB from here:
http://nvlabs.github.io/cub/
Place a symlink to the top-level CUB directory in $HOME. 
Assuming the top-level CUB directory is $CUBDIR:
  $ cd $HOME
  $ ln -s $CUBDIR
To build, type 'make' in the top-level directory, or
Go to each sub-directory, e.g. bfs, and then
  $ make
To run, set the following environment variable:
  $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=[ number of cores in system ]
Download datasets from the UFSMC or SNAP website:
  $ wget http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/MM/SNAP/soc-LiveJournal1.tar.gz
Decompress the dataset file and put it in the 'datasets' sub-directory, and run:
  $ cd bin
  $ ./bfs_base ../datasets/soc-LiveJournal1.mtx
